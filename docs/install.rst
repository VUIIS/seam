Installation
############

Install the latest version with `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::

    $ pip install seam

Seam is also distributed in the wheel format, so you can install it as a wheel::

    $ pip install --use-wheel seam

Note, this requires the `wheel <http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ package along with an up-to-date pip.

To install the bleeding edge from the github repo, use the following::

    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/VUIIS/seam.git#egg=seam

Either way, it has no dependencies.
